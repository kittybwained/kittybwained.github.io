        <p>First, log in as MAINT. Then, you must access the parmdisk. You probably already know how to do this, but if not:</p>
        <pre>
CPRELEASE A
LINK * CF1 CF1 MW
ACCESS CF1 Q
        </pre>
        <p>Now, you need to open INPTAREA SAMPLE Q in ISPF. Any other editor capable of hex editing will work, but the only one I know that can do that is ISPF. Run <code>HEX DATA</code> from the ISPF command line after opening the file.</p>
        <p>Locate record 4 (the line with PASSWORD ===>). Find the sequence of 8 null bytes (<code>0000000000000000</code>). After this, you should see <code>1D70</code>, followed by a bunch of <code>40</code>.</p>
        <p>Change <code>1D70</code> to <code>1D60110050</code>.</p>
        <p>Ok, we're now done with the editing. Now, you must return the parmdisk back to CP. To do this, run:</p>
        <pre>
RELEASE Q
DETACH CF1
CPACCESS MAINT CF1 A RR SYNCH
        </pre>
        <p>Now, spin up a new terminal or reconnect, and your password field should no longer skip.</p>
        <p>You may be wondering how I generated the datastream. This is the script I used:
        <pre>
/* */
'IOS3270 INPTEST (SCRIOSD'
PARSE VAR IOSD
'PIPE VAR IOSD | DISK SCREEN DATASTRM A'
        </pre>
        <code>INPTEST IOS3270 A</code> contains:
        <pre>
.jx set ctl # type=(tab unp invisible)
.CE+
#        +
        </pre>
        Then, I just opened the datastream file in ISPF and cherrypicked bits of the datastream until it worked.
